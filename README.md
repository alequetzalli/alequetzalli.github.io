# Getting started

## Dependencies
Just the Docs is built for Jekyll, a static site generator. View the quick start guide for more information. Just the Docs requires no special plugins and can run on GitHub Pagesâ€™ standard Jekyll compiler. The Jekyll SEO Tag plugin is included by default (no need to run any special installation) to inject SEO and open graph metadata on docs pages. For information on how to configure SEO and open graph metadata visit the Jekyll SEO Tag usage guide.
